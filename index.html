    <h1>Privacy Policy for Axis</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>Axis Health ("Axis", "we", "our", or "us") is a privacy-first personal health assistant. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the Axis mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you sign in with Google, we receive the following from your Google account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Google account ID</li>
        <li>Profile photo URL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is used solely to personalize your experience within the App.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Profile Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>During onboarding, you may optionally provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Date of birth</li>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Blood type</li>
        <li>Preferred language (English, Hindi, or Hinglish)</li>
        <li>Companion name preference</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is used to personalize health insights.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Health Data</h3>
    <p>The App allows you to create and manage the following types of health information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Spaces</strong> &mdash; dedicated areas for managing specific health conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Records</strong> &mdash; uploaded PDFs, scanned documents, and images of prescriptions, lab reports, or handwritten notes</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Transcriptions</strong> &mdash; transcribed doctor-patient conversations converted into formatted clinical notes</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Conversations</strong> &mdash; interactions with the voice health companion</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Conversations</strong> &mdash; text-based interactions within health spaces</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Logs</strong> &mdash; automatically generated health log entries (meals, activities, symptoms, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Insights</strong> &mdash; personalized health summaries based on your data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All health data is stored locally on your device by default.</strong> It is not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly initiate a specific action that requires processing (see Section 3).</p>

    <h3>1.4 Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We track daily usage of certain features (Voice Bot minutes, Transcriber minutes) <strong>locally on your device</strong> to enforce free-tier limits. This data is not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers for tracking or advertising</li>
        <li>Browsing or app usage analytics</li>
        <li>Contact lists or call logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The App contains <strong>no analytics SDKs, tracking pixels, or telemetry</strong> of any kind.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used exclusively to provide and improve the App's functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalization</strong> &mdash; tailoring health insights, daily cards, and companion responses to your profile and health history</li>
        <li><strong>Document Processing</strong> &mdash; extracting text and generating summaries from uploaded medical documents (see Section 3)</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Transcription</strong> &mdash; converting spoken audio into text for the clinical transcriber and voice companion features</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Limits</strong> &mdash; enforcing daily usage limits for free-tier users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising, marketing, profiling, or selling to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Processing &amp; Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>While Axis is designed to keep your data on your device, certain features require external processing. Below is a transparent account of when and why data may leave your device.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Google Sign-In (Authentication)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> Standard OAuth 2.0 flow &mdash; your email, name, and profile picture are retrieved from Google.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Account creation and authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Google Speech-to-Text</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> Audio recordings are sent to Google's Speech-to-Text API for transcription.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Powering the Voice Bot and Clinical Transcriber features.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Audio is processed in real time and is not stored by Google for this service tier. Transcribed text is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy:</strong> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/data-usage" target="_blank">Google Cloud Data Usage</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Axis AI Backend (Document Processing)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> When you upload a PDF or image for processing, the file content and document metadata (type, date) are sent to our backend service hosted on Google Cloud Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> OCR, text extraction, summarization, and generating document embeddings for semantic search.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Files are processed in transit and are <strong>not persistently stored</strong> on our servers. Processed results (text chunks, summaries, embeddings) are returned to and stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>What is NOT sent:</strong> Your profile information, chat history, memory logs, voice recordings, or any data beyond the specific document being processed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.4 Cloud AI Providers (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you choose a cloud-based AI engine during setup, chat and voice interactions are processed by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> &mdash; <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> &mdash; <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">Anthropic Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may alternatively select the <strong>on-device AI mode</strong> (powered by Gemma), which processes all conversations locally without any cloud transmission.</p>

    <h3>3.5 Google Drive (Optional Backup)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> If you explicitly enable Google Drive backup, your health space data is uploaded to <strong>your own</strong> Google Drive account.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> User-controlled backup and cross-device sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The App only accesses files it created (limited <code>drive.file</code> scope). It cannot read or modify your other Drive files.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable backup and disconnect Google Drive at any time from within the App settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.6 In-App Purchases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions are processed entirely through <strong>Apple App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play Store</strong> billing infrastructure.</li>
        <li>We do not collect or have access to your payment details (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.).</li>
        <li>Only your premium subscription status is stored locally to unlock features.</li>
        <li>Policies: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Care Circles (Shared Spaces)</h2>
    <p>Axis allows you to share health spaces with trusted family members or caregivers through Care Circles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Invitation:</strong> You invite members by email. They must accept and approve access.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Shared data is encrypted using RSA public-key cryptography. Each member's data is encrypted with their unique key pair.</li>
        <li><strong>Sync:</strong> Shared data is synced via participants' Google Drive accounts, encrypted end-to-end.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can remove members or delete a Care Circle at any time. Revoking access removes the shared encryption key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>

    <h3>5.1 On-Device Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored in a local database (ObjectBox) within the App's private storage sandbox, inaccessible to other apps.</li>
        <li>Medical documents are stored in an encrypted on-device vault (<code>AXIS_Vault</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Encryption</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensitive keys</strong> (RSA key pairs, encryption keys) are stored using platform-native secure storage (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain).</li>
        <li><strong>Care Circle data</strong> is encrypted with AES-256 before leaving the device.</li>
        <li><strong>Device-level encryption</strong> provided by your operating system (iOS Data Protection / Android file-based encryption) further protects all App data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Security Measures</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All network communication uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.</li>
        <li>OAuth 2.0 tokens are stored in secure, encrypted storage.</li>
        <li>The App does not cache or log sensitive health data outside of its secure storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Retention</h3>
    <p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as you use the App. We do not maintain copies of your data on our servers.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Deletion</h3>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete individual Health Spaces</strong> &mdash; removes all associated records, chats, logs, and documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Disconnect Google Drive</strong> &mdash; stops backup and removes the App's access to your Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall the App</strong> &mdash; removes all locally stored data from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> &mdash; contact us to request complete deletion of any residual data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Axis is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will promptly delete such information.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>When data is processed by third-party services (Google Speech-to-Text, our backend on Google Cloud Platform, or cloud AI providers), it may be transferred to and processed in servers located outside your country of residence, including the United States. These services maintain appropriate safeguards for data protection.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. For material changes, we will notify you through the App. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
